## 1. Brand Positioning

### Who We Are

Handshake is a research-driven GEO/AEO agency that helps organizations earn visibility, trust, and influence in AI-powered search systems.

We do not “do SEO.”

We engineer authority in generative and answer-first environments.

We operate at the intersection of:

- search systems
- language models
- knowledge engineering
- editorial governance

---

### What We Believe

1. Visibility without trust is fragile.
2. Authority compounds.
3. Structure beats volume.
4. Evidence beats opinion.
5. Systems beat hacks.

---

### Market Position

We position as:

> The infrastructure layer for AI search visibility.

Not:

- a content mill
- an SEO shop
- a growth-hack agency
- a “prompt engineering” vendor

We compete on rigor, not speed.

---

### Ideal Client

- Founders
- Heads of Growth
- Content Leaders
- Product Marketing Leads
- Strategy Teams
- Small to mid-sized businesses that can't afford a full-time SEO team

Who:

- care about defensibility
- invest long-term
- value systems
- dislike hype

---

## 2. Brand Voice

### Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Meaning in Practice |
| --- | --- |
| Clear | No jargon without definition |
| Precise | Specific claims, not vague language |
| Calm | No hype, no fear-mongering |
| Confident | State conclusions directly |
| Analytical | Explain why, not just what |
| Practical | Always connect to action |

---

### Voice Do

- “Here’s what changes in generative search.”
- “The evidence suggests…”
- “In practice, this means…”
- “Most teams overlook…”
- “A more reliable approach is…”

### Voice Don’t

- “Game-changing”
- “Revolutionary”
- “Secret hack”
- “Skyrocket your traffic”
- “You won’t believe…”

---

## 3. Tone by Context

### Educational (Guides, Glossaries)

Tone:

- neutral
- patient
- explanatory
- reference-style

Example:
> Generative engines prioritize sources that minimize uncertainty.

---

### Strategic (Positioning, Comparisons)

Tone:

- firm
- reasoned
- grounded in evidence

Example:
> Ranking remains important, but it no longer guarantees inclusion.

---

### Advisory (How-To, Playbooks)

Tone:

- supportive
- operational
- direct

Example:
> Start by mapping your existing content to a single pillar.

---

### Sales-Adjacent (CTAs, Services)

Tone:

- restrained
- consultative
- non-pushy

Example:
> If you want to assess your current GEO readiness, we offer a structured audit.

---

## 4. Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence Style

- Prefer short to medium sentences.
- Vary rhythm.
- Avoid long, multi-clause chains.

Example:
❌ Poor:
> In today’s rapidly evolving digital ecosystem…

✅ Good:
> Generative search changes how visibility works.

---

### Paragraph Structure

- 1 idea per paragraph
- 2–4 lines max
- New idea = new paragraph

---

### Terminology Discipline

Define once. Reuse consistently.

Example:

> Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) refers to…

Afterward:
Use “GEO,” not variations.

---

### Use of Emphasis

Allowed:

- bold for key terms
- italics for nuance
- block quotes for evidence

Avoid:

- excessive formatting
- ALL CAPS
- emoji in editorial content

---

## 5. Evidence & Authority Standards

### Citation Philosophy

We cite to:

- reduce uncertainty
- demonstrate rigor
- enable verification

Not to “look academic.”

---

### Source Hierarchy (Preferred)

1. Official platform documentation
2. Peer-reviewed research
3. Reputable industry studies
4. Primary data
5. Practitioner experience (clearly labeled)

---

### Claim Framing

| Type | How to Present |
| --- | --- |
| Verified fact | With citation |
| Industry consensus | With multiple sources |
| Observation | Label as experience |
| Hypothesis | Explicitly marked |

Never blur these.

---

## 6. Narrative Framing

### Preferred Frames

- “From ranking to selection”
- “From pages to passages”
- “From traffic to influence”
- “From volume to structure”
- “From tactics to systems”

Use consistently.

---

### Avoided Frames

- “War against Google”
- “SEO is dead”
- “AI apocalypse”
- “Replace marketers”

We do not sell fear.

---

## 7. Audience Relationship

### How We Treat Readers

Assume they are:

- intelligent
- busy
- skeptical
- capable of nuance

We do not condescend.

We do not oversimplify.

---

### Trust Building

Trust is earned by:

- admitting uncertainty
- showing work
- updating content
- correcting errors

Not by overconfidence.

---

## 8. Brand Language Library

### Preferred Terms

- generative systems
- citation likelihood
- passage-level authority
- knowledge architecture
- synthesis pipeline
- verification layer
- topical depth
- evidence density

---

### Discouraged Terms

- hacks
- tricks
- domination
- loopholes
- exploit

---

## 9. CTA & Conversion Style

### Primary Principle

Educate first. Invite second.

---

### Approved CTA Patterns

- “Run a GEO readiness audit”
- “Review your AI search visibility”
- “Assess your citation footprint”
- “Get a structured evaluation”

---

### CTA Placement

- End of guides
- Light modules in blogs
- Never mid-paragraph

---

## 10. Examples

### On Authority

> Authority in generative search is not about being loud. It is about being reliable.

---

### On Strategy

> The goal is not to rank for more queries. It is to be referenced in more answers.

---

### On Operations

> Systems that produce consistent quality outperform individual effort over time.

---

## 11. Enforcement

All content must pass:

- Editorial QA
- Evidence validation
- Tone alignment

before publication.

Non-compliant drafts are revised or rejected.

---

## 12. Core Principle

> We optimize for trust first. Everything else follows.
