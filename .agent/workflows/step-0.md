# STEP 0 — Knowledge Ingestion (MD Upload)

## Overview

Knowledge Ingestion is the foundation of the Handshake Content Copilot. Before any writing begins, you upload your internal research, frameworks, notes, and brand positioning into the workspace. This step ensures that the copilot operates from a consistent knowledge base rather than generating content from general AI training data alone.

The purpose of this step is threefold: first, it establishes brand consistency by ensuring all terminology, frameworks, and positioning align with your internal standards. Second, it prevents reinvention of concepts you've already developed and refined. Third, it dramatically reduces hallucination and unsupported claims because the copilot can ground its output in your actual research and playbooks.

This step is non-negotiable. Skipping it leads to generic, brand-misaligned content that requires heavy revision. Completing it thoroughly saves time and reduces quality risk downstream.

The workflow is simple: you upload Markdown files, the copilot parses them, extracts key concepts and terminology, builds a temporary knowledge map, and surfaces any conflicts or gaps. You then approve or clarify the knowledge summary before moving to Step 1.

Think of this as briefing a new team member on your company's intellectual property, research conclusions, and preferred language before asking them to write. The copilot becomes an extension of your team, not a generic AI.

## Workflow

### Inputs (Human)

Upload one or more Markdown files containing:

* Prior research and findings
* Internal playbooks and frameworks
* Draft posts or sections
* Proprietary terminology definitions
* Citation lists and source inventory
* Brand positioning documents
* Guides or standard operating procedures
* Competitive analysis
* Case studies or examples
* Frequently cited concepts or models

Files should be well-organized and clearly labeled. Include anything that defines how your team thinks, writes, or approaches your topic domain.

### Copilot Actions

1. Parse uploaded Markdown files
2. Extract and catalog:
   * Core concepts and definitions
   * Terminology and preferred phrasing
   * Recurring frameworks and models
   * Cited sources and references
   * Brand voice and tone markers
   * Strategic positioning statements
3. Build a temporary internal knowledge map
4. Cross-reference concepts for conflicts or overlaps
5. Flag ambiguities, contradictions, or incomplete definitions
6. Identify gaps or assumptions
7. Create a searchable index of key terms

### Outputs

The copilot produces:

* Knowledge Summary (narrative overview of extracted concepts)
* Terminology Map (key terms and definitions used in your materials)
* Frameworks Inventory (list of proprietary or adapted models)
* Source Inventory (all cited sources with publication details)
* Key Principles List (core beliefs or standards evident in uploads)
* Conflict Report (any contradictions or ambiguities detected)

### Human Checkpoint

Review and confirm:

* Knowledge was interpreted correctly
* All major concepts are represented
* Terminology aligns with your brand
* No critical sources are missing
* Frameworks are captured accurately

If any interpretation is incorrect, clarify or re-upload.

### Success Criteria

* All uploaded content is parsed and indexed
* Terminology map is complete and accurate
* No conflicting definitions exist
* Source inventory is comprehensive
* Copilot can reference knowledge map in subsequent steps

### Escalation

If uploads contain contradictory information, flag it explicitly before proceeding to Step 1. Resolve conflicts at this stage, not later.
