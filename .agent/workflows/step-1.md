# STEP 1 — Intake & Framing

## Overview

Intake and Framing translates a vague topic request into a clear editorial and strategic brief. This step forces clarity before any writing begins. It ensures you and the copilot are aligned on audience, intent, success criteria, and positioning before resources are invested in drafting.

Many content projects fail because the initial brief is unclear. A topic like "AI and SEO" is too broad to produce focused, authoritative output. This step narrowifies the scope, defines the reader, articulates the unique angle, and identifies potential risks (outdated information, missing data, competing content, unclear success metrics).

The copilot validates your input against the knowledge base from Step 0. If your topic overlaps heavily with existing content, it flags that early. If the topic requires sources you haven't provided, it identifies that now. If the angle is unclear or the audience is ambiguous, this step surfaces those gaps before writing begins.

By the end of this step, you have a refined topic statement, a clear thesis, a defined reader profile, and measurable success criteria. This becomes the creative brief for the next steps.

Expect this step to take 10-15 minutes. It feels like overhead but prevents much larger revisions downstream.

## Workflow

### Inputs (Human)

Required information:

* Content type: Blog or Guide
* Topic: Specific subject matter (not broad category)
* Pillar assignment: geo / aeo / ai-seo / ai-citations / eeat-ai
* Audience: Who is the reader? What is their role?
* Goal: What should the reader do or understand after reading?

Optional inputs:

* Keywords: Target search terms (if relevant)
* Angle: Specific perspective or approach (if known)
* Known sources: Papers, data, or citations you want included
* Preferred length: Short (~1200 words) / Standard (~1800 words) / Long (~2500+ words)
* Voice: Conversational / Formal / Practitioner / Academic

Example:

```
Type: Blog
Topic: How AI agents evaluate product descriptions for commerce
Pillar: aeo
Audience: WooCommerce store owners learning to optimize for AI
Goal: Help store owners write product descriptions that AI agents can parse accurately
Angle: Practical, step-by-step, avoid generic SEO advice
Sources: Optional; if known, list them
Length: Standard
Voice: Practitioner (knowledgeable but accessible)
```

### Copilot Actions

1. Validate input completeness
2. Cross-reference with knowledge base (from Step 0)
3. Detect editorial intent:
   * Is this exploratory, instructional, or argumentative?
   * Is the goal awareness, understanding, or action?
4. Identify risks:
   * Does existing content overlap?
   * Are sources available for this topic?
   * Is the topic too broad or too narrow?
   * Are there factual claims that require up-to-date data?
5. Refine topic statement for clarity
6. Define target reader profile in detail
7. Extract and articulate success criteria
8. Propose draft thesis statement

### Outputs

The copilot produces:

* Refined Topic Statement (1-2 sentences clarifying scope)
* Reader Profile (age, role, knowledge level, pain point, goal)
* Thesis Statement (core claim the content will defend)
* Success Criteria (measurable outcomes; e.g., reader can apply X, reader understands Y)
* Risk Assessment (gaps, overlaps, data availability)
* Recommended Content Length
* Suggested Voice and Tone
* Preliminary Outline Structure

### Human Checkpoint

Review and confirm:

* Topic is clear and appropriately scoped
* Reader profile matches your intended audience
* Success criteria are measurable
* Angle is defensible and unique
* Any identified risks are acceptable

Adjustments made here are cheap; adjustments after drafting are expensive.

### Success Criteria

* Input is complete and unambiguous
* Copilot demonstrates understanding of intent
* No major risks are unaddressed
* Reader profile is specific and accurate
* Success criteria can be objectively measured
* Thesis is defensible given available knowledge

### Common Fixes at This Stage

* Topic too broad → narrow the scope (e.g., "AI agents" → "how AI agents evaluate product descriptions")
* Audience unclear → define the specific role and their knowledge level
* Goal ambiguous → clarify whether the goal is awareness, understanding, or action
* Sources unavailable → switch to "no-claims mode" or request sources before proceeding
