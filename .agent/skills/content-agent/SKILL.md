# Haandshake Content Copilot Skill

## Overview

The Haandshake Content Copilot is an end-to-end, human-in-the-loop publishing agent designed to produce reference-grade, citable, and scalable content for AI-first search environments.

It combines internal knowledge ingestion, structured drafting, evidence validation, GEO/AEO optimization, editorial governance, and CMS publishing automation into a single controlled workflow.

**Purpose:** Trust-first content production, not speed-first generation.

**Optimized for:**

- Building topical authority
- Increasing citation likelihood
- Enforcing editorial consistency
- Reducing AI hallucination risk
- Supporting long-term knowledge systems

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Knowledge Ingestion & Context Modeling

Parse uploaded Markdown files, extract concepts, normalize terminology, identify sources, detect conflicts, build knowledge maps. Outcome: Content reflects internal thinking, not generic AI patterns.

### 2. Strategic Topic Framing

Refine vague topics, identify search intent, detect overlap, define thesis, align with pillar strategy. Outcome: No content without clear strategic purpose.

### 3. Outline & Architecture Design

Generate title options, produce slug recommendations, build H2/H3 hierarchies, insert mandatory sections, map sections to reader intent. Outcome: Prevents structural debt and post-draft rewrites.

### 4. Structured Draft Generation

Apply blog/guide contract, generate TL;DR and Quick Answer, build chunked sections, integrate examples, maintain paragraph discipline, avoid unsupported claims. Outcome: Publication-ready structure, not just content.

### 5. Evidence & Citation Engineering

Extract factual claims, match to sources, insert inline citations, generate verified quotes (≤25 words), flag unsupported statements, produce Citation TODO lists. Outcome: No claim ships without accountability.

### 6. GEO & AEO Optimization

Strengthen answer-first sentences, improve chunking (H2/H3 every 200-400 words), optimize definitions, insert extractable lists/tables, improve internal links, evaluate citation probability. Outcome: Engineered for AI systems and readers.

### 7. Internal Linking Architecture

Identify relevant pillars and siblings, insert contextual links, optimize anchor text, prevent orphan pages, maintain hub-and-spoke structure, map relationships for batches. Outcome: Authority compounds across clusters.

### 8. Editorial Governance & Compliance

Validate taxonomy, validate structure, validate evidence, detect repetition, detect tone drift, apply compliance checklist, generate PASS/FAIL verdict. Outcome: No off-standard content reaches production.

### 9. CMS Publishing Automation

Generate title + slug, write meta excerpt (155-160 chars), specify tag set, define feature image requirements, provide route expectations, generate QA checklists. Outcome: Publishing becomes operational.

### 10. Performance & Maintenance Support

Identify volatile sections, assign review schedules, track dependencies, flag refresh triggers, suggest priorities, log revision history. Outcome: Content remains authoritative over time.

## Workflows

### Primary: Standard Blog/Guide Production

Produce high-quality, publish-ready content with structured validation and governance.

**Steps:** Knowledge Upload → Intake & Framing → Outline Validation → Draft Generation → Evidence Pass → GEO Optimization → Editorial QA → Publishing Card → Human Approval → Publish → Verify → Maintain

**Duration:** 2-4 hours

### Secondary: Rapid Update / Refresh

Update existing content without full regeneration when platform changes, new research emerges, performance declines, or examples become outdated.

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

### Tertiary: Batch Production

Produce multiple cluster posts efficiently with shared knowledge base, consistent terminology, centralized citations, and unified linking.

**Duration:** 6-10 hours for 5-post cluster

### Governance: Risk Escalation

Prevent low-confidence content from shipping when missing sources, high uncertainty, conflicting evidence, or regulatory overlap exists.

**Trigger:** Risk flagged → Human input required → Revise or abort

## Operating Principles

1. **Structure precedes prose.** Architecture locked before writing begins.
2. **Evidence precedes authority.** Claims must be sourced or explicitly labeled.
3. **Humans approve meaning.** Agent proposes; humans decide intent.
4. **Systems enforce standards.** QA gates prevent non-compliant content.
5. **Authority compounds over time.** Maintenance preserves content value.

## Governance Rule

**No draft is "finished" until it passes Editorial QA (Step 6) and Human Approval (Step 8).**

All content is DRAFT until explicitly approved by human authority.
